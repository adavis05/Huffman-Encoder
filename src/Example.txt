I would love to work in all fields using my knowledge obtained through school in work. As an example, I would love to work in both the medical field and defense. I would not want to necessarily do this at the same time, but through different stages in my career. Work in robotics would greatly excel me in regards to programming in these fields. A new piece of medical equipment may have been created with the help of my programming skills and this piece of equipment might be able to detect whether cancerous cells will effect the body or not, before they begin to. Maybe a new missile system was developed that gives 50% more accuracy with the help of my robotics skills. This internship would bring me both the knowledge and skill I would need to potentially complete these things.Though I don't have experience directly related to this position, I do have experience with research at my prior internship. This internship required me to research a way to map a constantly updating txt file to a database. My research led me to Java being the easiest language to do this in and there even existed a package in which the company could use.I have classroom and work experience with researching software designs and Java and Python programming. In general, I have much high-level programming experience and also, some low-level programming experience using x86 Assembly Language. Throughout my coursework in college, I've been tasked with many textbooks projects. More specifically, in my Software Engineering class we were tasked with building a website for a healthcare company using Ruby and Javascript. Outside of the classroom, with the help of Lynda.com, I was able to get some experience with C/C++ and Objective C.
